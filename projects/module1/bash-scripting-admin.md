## Overview

Developed advanced Linux administration and security analysis skills through practical exercises in log analysis, access control, malware detection, and SSH key-based authentication.

---

## Core Skills Developed

### Log Analysis & Forensics
- Analyzed system logs for security incidents
- Filtered and parsed syslog files for specific events
- Identified duplicate and suspicious log entries
- Searched across multiple log files efficiently
- Used grep, awk, and sed for log pattern matching

### Malware Detection & Hidden Files
- Located hidden files in Linux systems
- Analyzed binary files for embedded data
- Identified malicious content using command-line tools
- Understood malware hiding techniques in Linux

### Access Control & Group Management
- Modified group memberships for file access
- Applied principle of least privilege
- Worked with file ownership and permission combinations
- Tested access control through group-based permissions
- Managed zero-permission files

### Environment Variables
- Located and extracted environment variable values
- Understood system configuration through environment
- Identified security-relevant environment settings

### Network Service Analysis
- Identified open ports on systems
- Detected unauthorized services
- Analyzed network service configurations
- Applied attack surface reduction principles

### SSH Key-Based Authentication
- Implemented public key authentication for SSH
- Managed private key files and permissions
- Connected to remote systems using key pairs
- Transferred keys between systems securely
- Understood asymmetric cryptography basics

### Text Processing & Filtering
- Used grep for pattern matching in files
- Applied awk for data extraction and processing
- Utilized sed for text transformation
- Implemented sort and uniq for data analysis
- Combined multiple tools for complex filtering

### Bash Scripting Fundamentals
- Created scripts with arguments and variables
- Implemented conditional logic
- Used loops for automation
- Combined commands for complex operations
